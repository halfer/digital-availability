    <!-- The main usage of the digital CV format will be people who self-publish
         their own CV. However, it is conceivable that folks will wish to
         publish on behalf of someone else, e.g. a recruiter offering a client
         list. They will need to electronically state they have consent to do so.

         I wonder also whether secondary CVs can be added for the purposes of language
         translation e.g. a CV for one person translated into both Italian and English.
         See the second <digital-cv> for how this could be achieved.

                    designed a simple Git-based automation approach to make config changes clean
